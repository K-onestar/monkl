        <h3>ONLINE SHOPPING</h3>
        <h4>How do I track and check the status of my order?</h4>
        <p>
            We don’t want to keep you guessing!
            <br>
            You can view the status of your order and track it under ‘My orders’ in the ‘My Account’ section in your Monki profile.
        </p>
        <h4>Help! I am locked out of my account.</h4>
        <p>
            If you’re having trouble logging into your account, don’t worry!
            <br>
            You can re-set your password by clicking the <strong>‘Forgot password?’</strong> link when you are signing in.
            <br>If this doesn’t work, please <a href="help_contact_us.html">Contact us.</a> We are happy to help!
        </p>
        <h4>When I add an item to my shopping bag, does it guarantee I have the item?</h4>
        <p>
            Placing an item into your shopping bag doesn't reserve the item.
            <br>
            In fact, the item could sell out if other customers place orders of the same product before you check out.
            <br>
            If this happens, we will notify you by email that we are unable to ship the item that you have ordered.
            <br>
            And of course, you won't be charged for it. 
        </p>
        <h4>How long will my order take?</h4>
        <p>
            Your order will normally leave our warehouse on the working day after you place your order - or earlier.
            <br>
            e will deliver your purchase within 3-5 working days after receiving your order confirmation.
            <br>
            Federate States of Micronesia, Northen Mariana Islands, Tuvalu, Wallis and Futuna and certain remote places can take 5-6 days.
            <br>
            During high season and Sale, delivery might take a little longer, so please remember to order as early as you can. 
        </p>
        <h4>Is all the merchandise that is available at Monki stores also available online?</h4>
        <p>
            Yes! And even more actually - with our Online exclusives !
        </p>
        <h4>I cannot find the item I am looking for, what’s wrong?</h4>
        <p>
            At monki.com we keep similar stock as our stores.
            <br>
            If you are unable to find an item at this time, please check back soon as we continuously strive to re-stock.
        </p>
        <h4>Where do I add my discount code?</h4>
        <p>
            The discount code is to be added in your shopping bag before proceeding to checkout.
            <br>
            Click on <strong>“Got a discount code?”</strong> located just above your order value.
            <br>
            Then type in the code and click <strong>”Add”</strong> to update the total amount of your order.
            <br>
            Remember that you can’t combine the code with other discounts.
            <br>
            Also, please note that the code is case sensitive.
            <br>
            For example, if your discount code is ”DISCOUNT”, the code will not work if you type in ”discount” instead.
            <br>
            Want to remove the code for some reason? Simply press “Remove”.
        </p>

        <h3>RETURN AND REFUND</h3>
        <h4>Can I return items I bought?</h4>
        <p>
            Yes, you can return items for a 25 USD fee that will be deducted from your refund when the return is processed.
            <br>
            If you aren't satisfied with your order, you can return it within 30 days - and get a full refund within two weeks.

        </p>

        <h3>SIZES AND GARMENTS</h3>
        <h4>Do you have any size charts on the website?</h4>
        <p>
            Indeed we do!
            <br>
            Check out our <a href="help_size_guide.html">Size guide.</a>
            <br>
            We’ve also put together a Monki fit guide with descriptions and short videos to show you exactly how our three different fits looks when you wear them. Learn more <a href="help_size_guide.html">here.</a>
        </p>
        <h4>When you use the word "Oversized" in a product description, what does that mean?</h4>
        <p>
            We know how important it is for a <a href="list_tops_tshirt_clothes.html">top</a>, <a href="list_jumpsuits_dungarees_clothes.html">jumper</a> or <a href="list_skirt_clothes.html">skirt</a> to fit as it should, so we do try to take time to let you know about its measurements.
            <br>
            When you see the word oversized in our text we are saying the <a href="list_coats_jackets_clothes.html">coat</a>, <a href="list_troussers_blouses_clothes.html">shirt</a>, <a href="list_coats_jackets_clothes.html">coat</a>, <a href="list_troussers_blouses_clothes.html">blouse</a> or other Monki pieces are not fitted and are tailored to look slightly larger.
            <br>
            We love the oversized look and believe it is part of the Monki silhouette.
            <br>
            If you are looking for the garment to hug your body a little bit more grab the size down.
            <br>
            Want to learn more? Check out our  <a href="help_size_guide.html">Size guide</a>, or visit our <a href="help_size_guide.html">Fit guide</a> to see a short video of how the oversized fit looks when you wear it.
        </p>
        <h4>Where can I find out more about a garment on your site?</h4>
        <p>
            Added bits of information about a garment or accessory can be found in the highlighted "Description" section next to each item. 
        </p>
        <h4>Will I find fur products in your range?</h4>
        <p>
            We don’t sell any fur products at all, except faux fur (which is fake).
            <br>
            We also don’t sell merino wool, down or feathers - unless we’re certain they’re cruelty free.
            <br>
            Also, we don’t sell angora at all any more.
        </p>
        <h4>What about leather?</h4>
        <p>
            The absolute majority of our leather products are faux leather (also called fake leather or fleather).
            <br>
            We do have a strict policy for the real leather products that you will find in our assortment, and that is to only use material that is a by-product of the meat industry.
            <br>
            You can always check the “Details” section of each item to see if a product is a faux leather or a real leather product.
        </p>

        <h3>OTHER QUESTIONS</h3>
        <h4>Is there a smartphone-friendly version of the website?</h4>
        <p>
            We maintain our website to be very responsive for smartphones.
            <br>
            In fact, it is so responsive we didn’t feel the need to create an app.
        </p>
        <h4>Are you looking for new suppliers or wishing to expand your supply clientele?</h4>
        <p>
            At this current time, we are happy with the supplies we have and will not be making any changes.
            <br>
            If and when we do decide on change, we'll be sure to see who can best meet our needs so we can continue to provide our customer´s with the best in Monki fashion.
