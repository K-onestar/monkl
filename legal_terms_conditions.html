                    MONKI guarantees a full refund for any returned items in accordance with section 5 (Withdrawal of Order), provided that all items are returned in the same condition they were in upon your receipt.
                    <br>
                    This means the items should not have been damaged, soiled, washed, altered or worn (other than to try the item on) and that any labels or tags should be intact.
                    <br>
                    MONKI holds the right to determine the state of the returned item and decide on the refund.
