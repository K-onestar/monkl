        <p>
            Paying some extra attention to how you wash your clothes will make them live longer, look better and make less of a negative impact on the planet.
            <br>
            The washing instructions on the label will give you advise on how to care for your garment (beside checking out the symbols, please read the additional information on the label carefully too) but here are some other resourceful advice for you on how to treat your Monki clothes in the best possible way.
        </p>
        <h4>Chunky-knits</h4>
        <p>
            Chunky-knits should be reshaped and dried flat to maintain the original shape.
        </p>
        <h4>Viscose and jersey</h4>
        <p>
            Viscose and jersey natural materials and can easily get misshapen when wet.
            <br>
            To restore the garment easily to its original shape, iron it with a steam iron.
        </p>
        <h4>Wool</h4>
        <p>
            Often, airing woollen garments is enough.
            <br>
            Use a detergent for delicates when you do wash them.
            <br>
            To keep them looking as good as possible, the wool or hand wash cycle on your washing machine is preferable.
            <br>
            If you wash by hand, please do not soak for long.
            <br>
            Iron woven garments on the backside after washing to restore the natural sheen.
        </p>
        <h4>Silk</h4>
        <p>
            Silk is a very delicate material and should be treated with care.
            <br>
            Use a detergent for delicates when washing silk and do not stretch the garment while wet.
        </p>
        <h4>Linen</h4>
        <p>
            Linen is a natural material and can easily get misshapen when wet.
            <br>
            To restore the garment to its original shape, iron it with a hot steam iron.
            <br>
            To keep its sheen, iron the garment on the reverse side.
        </p>
        <h4>Denim</h4>
        <p>
            Wash jeans inside out to stop them fading.
            <br>
            Remove them from the washing machine as soon as possible after the programme has ended to avoid creasing.
            <br>
            Denim’s characteristic appearance is the result of a special dyeing method.
            <br>
            As a result, small pigment particles may remain on the surface and can rub off.
        </p>
        <h4>Leather</h4>
        <p>
            Leather and suede items should be taken to a specialist leather dry cleaner.
        </p>
        <h4>Coated fabrics</h4>
        <p>
            Coated fabrics should drip-dry.
            <br>
            If you dry them in a drying cabinet, do so at a low temperature.
        </p>
        <h4>Details</h4>
        <p>
            Take off removable details and do up Velcro and zip fastenings before washing.
            <br>
            Wash nylon tights and delicate garments with details in a laundry bag.
            <br>
            Avoid using fabric conditioners, unless you are washing garments that are 100 % synthetic, such as acrylic, as this counters static electricity in the garment after washing.
        </p>
        <h4>ECO-LOGICAL WASHING</h4>
        <p>
            We’re convinced that we can create clothing collections that enable our customers to express their personality and at the same time care about our planet.
            <br>
            And we work hard at it! But the environmental impact of a garment doesn’t stop after a garment has been produced and delivered to you.
            <br>
            The greatest share of energy consumption in its life-cycle actually occurs when you wash it.
            <br>
            That’s why we think it makes sense to help you help us reduce the amount of energy each garment consumes in its lifetime by providing sound advice on a more ecological - and logical - way of washing.
        </p>

            <br>
            The “use” phase covers: washing 25 times at 60°, with tumble drying and ironing.

        </p>
        <h3>Here are a few really easy tips on how to help save the planet!</h3>
        <h4>Don’t wash clothes unnecessarily</h4>
        <p>
            Don’t wash clothes that are not dirty.
            <br>
            Try airing and brushing more instead - it’s good for Mother Earth and your clothes.
        </p>
        <h4>Lower the washing temperature</h4>
        <p>
            We always label our garments with the highest temperature allowed.
            <br>
            But you can select a lower washing temperature to save energy.
            <br>
            Most detergents wash just as well at lower temperatures.
            <br>
            Washing at 40°C uses around half as much energy as washing at 60°C.
            <br>
            (We do recommend that you wash heavily soiled clothes and underwear at the highest permitted temperature).
        </p>
        <h4>Fill your washing machine</h4>
        <p>
            Sort the clothes by colour and washing temperature.
            <br>
            Fill up your washing machine, but don’t stuff too much in.
            <br>
            A washing machine is full when you can easily place a clenched fist on top of the washing.
            <br>
            Use an energy saving programme - most modern washing machines have one.
        </p>
        <h4>Choose an eco-friendly laundry detergent</h4>
        <p>
            Use an environmentally friendly detergent.
            <br>
            Your best choice is one of the new ones, made especially for low temperature.
            <br>
            Make sure you dose the detergent as stated on the packaging.
            <br>
            Overdosing detergent will not make your clothes cleaner.
            <br>
            The excess foam may in fact cause the reverse, less clean clothes.
            <br>
            To get the dose right, you need to know whether you have hard or soft water.
            <br>
            Avoid using fabric conditioners, unless you are washing acrylic garments as this counters static electricity in the garment after washing.
        </p>
        <h4>Avoid dry cleaning</h4>
        <p>
            Dry cleaning is a process in which the clothes are cleaned using an organic solvent.
            <br>
            It has negative environmental impact when the solvent is released into nature.
            <br>
            At Monki, we avoid creating dry clean clothes, except where it is necessary to achieve the artistic vision of the design.
            <br>
            Therefore, a small proportion of our garments are dry clean only, that is they contain details or materials than could change colour or become misshapen by washing at home.
            <br>
            Today, there are also greener methods of dry cleaning that clean the clothes using only carbon dioxide reclaimed from industry.
            <br>
            This method therefore does not release chemicals. Ask your local dry cleaner!
        </p>
        <h4>Leave your washing out to dry</h4>
        <p>
            An easy way of reducing energy consumption while washing (that also reduces the cost of washing) is to leave your washing out to dry.
            <br>
            Tumble drying and drying cabinets use a lot of energy.
            <br>
            To reduce drying time, spin the clothes well before taking them out of the washing machine.
        </p>
        <h4>Give away your clothes!</h4>
        <p>
            When you no longer have a use for clothes, give them to an organisation that can extend the garment’s life and let someone else enjoy it.
        </p>
